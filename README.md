# Arduino EEPROM Programmer Interface

Inspired by [Ben Eater's EEPROM Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K88pgWhEb1M), this is a console interface to communicate with the Arduino; enabling the user to easily write files to the EEPROM and read the contents. Currently, it only supports AT28C64X and AT28C256 chips.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some EEPROMs come with SDP (Software Data Protection) enabled by default. You may need to disable it before writing to the chip.
